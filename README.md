# Portfolio

This is a personal site that I've built with it's design inspired by [Keita Yamada](https://p5aholic.me/).

## Things to Update
- I'm not sure how I feel about the random doodle going on in the back
- Maybe try to see how squigly box looks compared to the straight box currently outlining the site
- I want to add one more section, but not decided on what as of yet. Some candidates are:
  - Coffee
  - Arsenal
  - Baduk
  - Genshin
